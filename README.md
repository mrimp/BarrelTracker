# BarrelTracker

BarrelTracker is a local-only tool for tracking precision rifle barrel
performance over time using real match and practice data.

## What it does
- Ranks barrels by **current form**, not lifetime averages
- Prioritizes **vertical dispersion** at distance
- Weights results by **confidence**
- Imports ShotMarker targets and paired chrono files
- Runs entirely in your browser (no uploads, no servers)

## Typical workflow
1. Add or select a barrel
2. Import ShotMarker + chrono files
3. Review auto-paired sessions
4. Generate session rows
5. Compare barrels in the ranking strip

## Notes
- Everything stays local
- Manual entry exists as a fallback, not the primary workflow
- Designed for long-range / F-Class style evaluation
