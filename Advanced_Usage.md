Lifecycle Events (Advanced)
BarrelTracker supports optional lifecycle events (setbacks, tuner changes, lot swaps, scope reinstall/swaps, and action work) to annotate the barrel timeline and explain performance shifts over time. Events do not affect scoring or rankings — they provide context only. Advanced users can log and edit these events, which appear as markers on charts and in the barrel timeline. The full event model is documented in EVENTS_SPEC.md
